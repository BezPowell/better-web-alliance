# Privacy Policy
I care about your privacy. Unlike many sites that start their privacy policy with these words, however, I actually mean them. I don’t like being constantly tracked and profiled when I’m online, and I assume that you don’t either; I also assume that rather than reading some deliberately obscure legalese, you’d rather read plain English.

To that end; this site has no cookies, tracking scripts, adverts, newsletter signups, or analytics. The only personal data that is collected on the site is whatever you choose to enter into the contact form. This is processed by Basin to send to me.

Basin have a privacy policy, Basin Privacy Policy, which you can read to see how they process any data entered into the contact form. If you choose not to use the contact form, of course, no personal data will be collected.
